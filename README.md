# ChatDB
### an interactive ChatGPT-like application that assists users in learning how to query data in database systems, including SQL and NoSQL databases. For example, it can suggest sample queries, including ones that include specific language constructs, and understand queries in natural language. But unlike ChatGPT, it can also execute the queries in the database systems and display the query results to the users.
